## Purpose

Place your formatted sample DOCX file here. This file will be used as a template to extract exact formatting preferences.

## Instructions

1. **Name your file:** `sample_formatted.docx`
2. **Include in your sample:**
   - Header information (title, date, etc.)
   - At least one example of each content type:
     - A speaker line
     - A scripture reference
     - A music/song line
     - Regular narration text
3. **Why this matters:** The application reads this file to extract font sizes, colors, bold/italic settings, indentation, and alignment to ensure every formatted transcript matches your preferred style.

## Example Structure

Your `sample_formatted.docx` should demonstrate the exact formatting you want:

```
[Title/Header]
Date: [Date]

Dr. Billy Wilson: Welcome to the sermon today.

Isaiah 40:31 - But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength.

♪ Amazing Grace ♪

The application will extract the styles from these examples and apply them consistently.
